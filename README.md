# Amanda Hogan
## Full Stack Web Developer

As an innovative Software Engineer and Web Developer, I offer a track record of success in developing full-stack web applications for business and commercial use. I also test, troubleshoot, and resolve customer issues to enhance overall productivity, quality, and the user experience by delivering product features and upgrades with intuitive functionality.

Examples of my work include:

- Collaborated with the engineering team lead to optimize TeamSyncedâ€™s customer database, using Ruby on Rails, for enhanced metrics around account engagement to provide better insights for the sales teams on overall account health which reduced churn and helped exceed the annual ARR goal by 10% two years in a row

- Grew customer engagement 300% in six months by continuously improving onboarding methods, leading the distribution of messaging designed to support teams in deriving the optimal value of the product, and maintaining relevant documentation for internal and external users to improve consistency and reduce support requests through self-help features

- Implemented end-to-end testing across the entire TeamSynced web application using Cypress to automate repetitive tasks and streamline shipping new features and critical fixes

- Built a real-time chat app using GraphQL, Prisma, Apollo, and React with design elements in Material UI to help the project comply with WCAG 2.0 standards

- Created a Google Chrome extension, using JavaScript and state management principles, that allows users to track their apparel and footwear sizes for quick, convenient access when online shopping

My previous experiences have supplemented my skills in leadership, communication, and critical thinking along with strengthening my ability to creatively solve problems, effectively make decisions, and resolve conflict. I work well with others and am highly adaptable to continuously evolving environments. My attention to detail, creativity, organization, and time-management skills help me prioritize tasks to meet deadlines with high-quality work. I am a self-starter, a quick learner, and have experience working with HTML5, CSS3, Material UI, JavaScript, React, jQuery, Ruby on Rails, GraphQL, Apollo, Prisma, NodeJS, Express, Cypress, Jest, RSpec, PostgreSQL, and REST APIs.
